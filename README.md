# Gøldbot

Goldbot, officially known as Gøldbot, is a simple, multipurpose bot built in Python that I made for a school project and that just built around afterwards.

## TODO:
- [x] Separate all commands in different cogs.
- [x] Use Discord.py's `HelpCommand` system.
- [x] Make all command descriptions use first person when referring to Gøldbot.
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!translate`.
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!morse`.
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!binary`.
- [ ] Add setup instructions to this README file.
