# Junøbot

Junobot, officially known as Junøbot, is a simple, multipurpose bot built in Python that I made for a school project and
that just built around afterward.

## TODO:

- [x] Separate all commands in different cogs.
- [x] Use Discord.py's `HelpCommand` system.
- [ ] Make all command descriptions use first person when referring to Junøbot.
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!translate`.
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!morse`.
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!binary`.
- [ ] Add setup instructions to this README file.
