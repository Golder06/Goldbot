# Gøldbot

Goldbot, officially known as Gøldbot, is a simple, multipurpose bot built in Python that I made for a school project and that just built around afterwards.

## TODO:
- [x] Separate all commands in different cogs
- [x] Use Discord.py's `HelpCommand` system
- [ ] Make all command descriptions use first person to refer to Gøldbot.
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!translate`
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!morse`
- [ ] Add subcommands for `g!binary`
- [ ] Overhaul `g!translate` to get it to actually work.
- [ ] Overhaul `g!language` to get it to actually work.
